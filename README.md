## Introducing CURE

CURE is a deflationary token that aims to generate continuous liquidity through mechanisms of mandatory community consensus, rewards vs. punishments, and fixed supply of tokens. Team CURE believes that the traditional approach to incentivize users to farm tokens by minting more tokens is unsustainable. We want to create a token that goes the other way to gain more value. 

### CURE features

- **Rewards vs. Punishments**: ALL staked tokens will be used to generate liquidity. Users who unstake will only get 1% principal back. 
  - Rewards: Harvesting tokens
  - Punishments: Principal deducted
  

- **Fixed supply**: Total amount of CURE tokens minted will be 800,000. 200,000 tokens will be added to the initial liquidity pool, while the remaining 600,000 will be minted through farming, with 20,000 created daily and halved every 15 days. 


- **Security**: Timelock and [Liquidity Lock](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x089A502032166e07Ae83eb434c16790cA2FA4661?name=Cure%20Farm&symbol=CURE) are implemented.



## Token Allocation

Uniswap pays 0.3% per each swap into the LP tokens as a fee. Due to CURE LP tokens being locked, they keep getting more valuable inside the pool while the liquidity is increasing. The fixed supply of coins allows the price floor to grow. 

## Tokenomics

Many people believe that if there is more liquidity added to the liquidity pool, the price of tokens will be stable. It is undeniable that the project with a big amount of liquidity will keep the price stable. Therefore, CURE's motivation to maintain constant growth of liquidity comes from that fact.
